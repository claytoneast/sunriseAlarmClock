## The Alarm Clock of Destiny

Arduino sketch for controlling a servo based on the time of day.   
Designed to slowly fade in an LED dimmer switch a la https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RZUX8S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 at the proper time of day for waking up. Will be using a DS3231 RTC module for time-keeping.

Built in Platform.IO to take advantage of the Atom text editor integration, since the Arduino IDE is trash.

Easily the greatest waste of time yet in my life. Note to self: Buy a Philips Hue bulb next time.
