## The Alarm Clock of Destiny

Arduino sketch for controlling a servo based on the time of day.   
Designed to slowly fade in an LED dimmer switch a la https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RZUX8S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 at the proper time of day for waking up. Will be using a DS3231 RTC module for time-keeping.

RTC unit must be synced to real time somehow, I used the serial monitor and manually set it. 


Easily the greatest waste of time yet in my life. Note to self: Buy a Philips Hue bulb next time.
